			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p><strong>A word from our founder:</strong> As a vegetarian myself, I know how important it is to find suitable supplements for meat 
			within the diet and how it is easy to create meals that donâ€™t contain the necessary minerals and vitamins
			that people must consume daily. What I hope to achieve is to create a collective of recipes from 
			different cultural backgrounds, using various ingredients, and compile them into a meaningful and 
			user-centred website. </p>
			<p><em>- Amy Anderson</em></p>

			<p style="margin-top:50px;">Here at Eat Your Greens we strive to provide the top-quality, nutrient rich recipes and meals for those
			following vegetarianism, or even those who would like to try a meat-free meal every once in a while. A vegetarian
			diet does not contain any meat, poultry or seafood, stripping a meal of much needed proteins, however, the
			Earth shall provide alternatives in the form of protein-rich plants and foods with much needed vitamins and minerals.</p>
